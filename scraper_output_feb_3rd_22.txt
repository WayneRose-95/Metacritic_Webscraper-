{'Title': "JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE ALL-STAR BATTLE", 'Platform': 'PlayStation 3', 'Release_Date': 'Apr 29, 2014', 'MetaCritic_Score': '71', 'User_Score': '8.1', 'Developer': 'CyberConnect2', 'Description': 'A lot of the critical reviews for this game appear to be from people who have probably never read the JoJo manga before and are simply judging it on the basis of being a complete outsider to the series. To me this seems unfair to what this game was meant to be; first and foremost, this game was designed to be fanservice for fans of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure. So far only Parts 1-3 have been animated, and the other 5 story arcs most likely won\'t be animated for a few years. However, this game brings the entire manga to life. If there\'s one thing you can truly say about this game, it\'s that it is incredibly loyal to the manga that it\'s based on. While there is a heavier focus on characters from Parts 2-5, no story arc in the manga has been left in the dust. You can play as several of your favourite characters in the series, and if you can\'t fight as them, at the very least you\'re likely to find them appear in the background of a stage, as a stage hazard, as one of the many characters guiding your around the game\'s menus, as one of the characters giving you support items and battery charge in the campaign or appearing in some other way. In Japan at least, the game\'s release was such an affair that the game itself had it\'s own training with JoJo characters all over it running for a few weeks.\n\nThe game itself has great graphics, some have complained in the past about the Japanese version being only 30fps, but the game itself looks so fluid now that I think the fps has become better. only during certain animations or stages does the fps seem to drop slightly. The game at it\'s core is a pretty solid fighter. It\'s not about to redefine the genre or give Street Fighter and Guilty Gear a run for their money, but overall I could imagine people playing this game at tournaments. With that said, at the very top levels of play, certain characters do have an edge over others (Jolyne and Johnny come to mind) and some characters just aren\'t going to fare that well against others (Valentine). However, most players don\'t play at this level, and the game is designed so that even newer players stand a chance against experience players who use combos and understand the mechanics of the game well. As for mechanics specific to this game, there are stylish moves which are similar to parrying in 3rd Strike (block at the exact time someone attacks you), Stand Rush (using a stand attack, and then being able to rush down the other player with your character as your stand attacks; can be used for certain combos), puttstun cancelling (similar to roman cancel in guilty gear) and also taunt cancelling to do certain combos.\n\nOne thing about this game is that it stays incredibly loyal to the manga in terms of poses the characters make, outfits that can be unlocked, dialogue the characters have among one another. Also the abilities themselves, even the ones that seem broken at first, are in the game and made to be somewhat balanced overall. For example, you can become Ultimate Kars, Use C-Moon and Made In Heaven as Enrico, you can get Gold Experience Requiem as Giorno, you can stop time and reenact the final battle of Jotaro vs DIO in Jotaro vs DIO matches, you can upgrade Tusk up to Act 4 and use him essentially exactly as Johnny does (complete with "Chummiiii!" sounds), you can use all of Mista\'s Sex Pistols to have bullets flying all around the screen, you can make Joseph taunt by telling people what they\'re going to say next. As I\'ve said previously, this game is at its core, a work of fanservice for fans of the JoJo manga. In this sense, it\'s a great work. Some have complained about renamings in the localizations, but at the end of the day these renames are mostly in subtitles only. You will always hear Avdol call Polnareff "Polnareff" even if the subtitles say "Eiffel". You can always turn subs off, but honestly if you\'ve read the manga and know all the characters, you are always going to hear Jolyne crying out "Stone Free!" or Giorno saying "Gold Experience Requiem!" among others.\n\nOverall, I would say if you are a fan of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, you\'re just depriving yourself if you don\'t buy this game. If you\'re a fan of the fighting genre, try the game out as a demo or at a friend\'s house and see if you think it would be fun for you. I would almost give this game a perfect 10, but the lack of character balance at top tiers, the sloppy launch by Bandai-Namco USA and the occasionally laggy netcode all detract from the experience. If the netcode and character balance was improved by patching from Namco/CC2, I\'d give this game a perfect 10 as being one of the best new fighters and one of the best products ever produced in the JoJo franchise.'}

Noel\'s life and the fate of the entire world hang in the balance as Ragna the Bloodedge marches toward one last confrontation. BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma introduces a new fighting system called "Overdrive." With this, characters can become more powerful, possibly enough to turn the tide of battle. The fighting has also been sped up, meaning faster, more enjoyable play.'}

The roster is massive and it has something for everyone, from the likes of Hogan and Andre to Austin and The Rock, right up to guys like CM Punk and Daniel Bryan.The game itself is very similar to WWE'13, the people about this game clearly can't comprehend the fact that this is still a THQ game with the 2K logo plastered all over it, you cannot expect to see 2Ks input until next years title at the very least. However, the game modes such as WWE Universe and 30 Years of WrestleMania make this game very entertaining, with a lot of archive footage being used to tell the stories of each match. As for the creative side of things, I'd say this years game is the best ever, there have been numerous improvements to the CAW mode, players allowed to now use in-game wrestlers like Jericho and Punk as a template, Create-A-Finisher and Create-an-Arena are still as strong as they were in the previous titles so there's a lot to offer for those people that are into the creative side of things.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is great! I'd recommend it to anyone who is a hardcore wrestling fan or even someone who is just a casual fan, it's very entertaining and worth the £35 price tag."}

{'Title': "JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE ALL-STAR BATTLE", 'Platform': 'PlayStation 3', 'Release_Date': 'Apr 29, 2014', 'MetaCritic_Score': '71', 'User_Score': '8.1', 'Developer': 'CyberConnect2', 'Description': 'A lot of the critical reviews for this game appear to be from people who have probably never read the JoJo manga before and are simply judging it on the basis of being a complete outsider to the series. To me this seems unfair to what this game was meant to be; first and foremost, this game was designed to be fanservice for fans of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure. So far only Parts 1-3 have been animated, and the other 5 story arcs most likely won\'t be animated for a few years. However, this game brings the entire manga to life. If there\'s one thing you can truly say about this game, it\'s that it is incredibly loyal to the manga that it\'s based on. While there is a heavier focus on characters from Parts 2-5, no story arc in the manga has been left in the dust. You can play as several of your favourite characters in the series, and if you can\'t fight as them, at the very least you\'re likely to find them appear in the background of a stage, as a stage hazard, as one of the many characters guiding your around the game\'s menus, as one of the characters giving you support items and battery charge in the campaign or appearing in some other way. In Japan at least, the game\'s release was such an affair that the game itself had it\'s own training with JoJo characters all over it running for a few weeks.\n\nThe game itself has great graphics, some have complained in the past about the Japanese version being only 30fps, but the game itself looks so fluid now that I think the fps has become better. only during certain animations or stages does the fps seem to drop slightly. The game at it\'s core is a pretty solid fighter. It\'s not about to redefine the genre or give Street Fighter and Guilty Gear a run for their money, but overall I could imagine people playing this game at tournaments. With that said, at the very top levels of play, certain characters do have an edge over others (Jolyne and Johnny come to mind) and some characters just aren\'t going to fare that well against others (Valentine). However, most players don\'t play at this level, and the game is designed so that even newer players stand a chance against experience players who use combos and understand the mechanics of the game well. As for mechanics specific to this game, there are stylish moves which are similar to parrying in 3rd Strike (block at the exact time someone attacks you), Stand Rush (using a stand attack, and then being able to rush down the other player with your character as your stand attacks; can be used for certain combos), puttstun cancelling (similar to roman cancel in guilty gear) and also taunt cancelling to do certain combos.\n\nOne thing about this game is that it stays incredibly loyal to the manga in terms of poses the characters make, outfits that can be unlocked, dialogue the characters have among one another. Also the abilities themselves, even the ones that seem broken at first, are in the game and made to be somewhat balanced overall. For example, you can become Ultimate Kars, Use C-Moon and Made In Heaven as Enrico, you can get Gold Experience Requiem as Giorno, you can stop time and reenact the final battle of Jotaro vs DIO in Jotaro vs DIO matches, you can upgrade Tusk up to Act 4 and use him essentially exactly as Johnny does (complete with "Chummiiii!" sounds), you can use all of Mista\'s Sex Pistols to have bullets flying all around the screen, you can make Joseph taunt by telling people what they\'re going to say next. As I\'ve said previously, this game is at its core, a work of fanservice for fans of the JoJo manga. In this sense, it\'s a great work. Some have complained about renamings in the localizations, but at the end of the day these renames are mostly in subtitles only. You will always hear Avdol call Polnareff "Polnareff" even if the subtitles say "Eiffel". You can always turn subs off, but honestly if you\'ve read the manga and know all the characters, you are always going to hear Jolyne crying out "Stone Free!" or Giorno saying "Gold Experience Requiem!" among others.\n\nOverall, I would say if you are a fan of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, you\'re just depriving yourself if you don\'t buy this game. If you\'re a fan of the fighting genre, try the game out as a demo or at a friend\'s house and see if you think it would be fun for you. I would almost give this game a perfect 10, but the lack of character balance at top tiers, the sloppy launch by Bandai-Namco USA and the occasionally laggy netcode all detract from the experience. If the netcode and character balance was improved by patching from Namco/CC2, I\'d give this game a perfect 10 as being one of the best new fighters and one of the best products ever produced in the JoJo franchise.'}

However, the game modes such as WWE Universe and 30 Years of WrestleMania make this game very entertaining, with a lot of archive footage being used to tell the stories of each match. As for the creative side of things, I'd say this years game is the best ever, there have been numerous improvements to the CAW mode, players allowed to now use in-game wrestlers like Jericho and Punk as a template, Create-A-Finisher and Create-an-Arena are still as strong as they were in the previous titles so there's a lot to offer for those people that are into the creative side of things.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is great!

{'Title': "JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE ALL-STAR BATTLE", 'Platform': 'PlayStation 3', 'Release_Date': 'Apr 29, 2014', 'MetaCritic_Score': '71', 'User_Score': '8.1', 'Developer': 'CyberConnect2', 'Description': 'A lot of the critical reviews for this game appear to be from people who have probably never read the JoJo manga before and are simply judging it on the basis of being a complete outsider to the series. To me this seems unfair to what this game was meant to be; first and foremost, this game was designed to be fanservice for fans of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure. So far only Parts 1-3 have been animated, and the other 5 story arcs most likely won\'t be animated for a few years. However, this game brings the entire manga to life. If there\'s one thing you can truly say about this game, it\'s that it is incredibly loyal to the manga that it\'s based on. While there is a heavier focus on characters from Parts 2-5, no story arc in the manga has been left in the dust. You can play as several of your favourite characters in the series, and if you can\'t fight as them, at the very least you\'re likely to find them appear in the background of a stage, as a stage hazard, as one of the many characters guiding your around the game\'s menus, as one of the characters giving you support items and battery charge in the campaign or appearing in some other way. In Japan at least, the game\'s release was such an affair that the game itself had it\'s own training with JoJo characters all over it running for a few weeks.\n\nThe game itself has great graphics, some have complained in the past about the Japanese version being only 30fps, but the game itself looks so fluid now that I think the fps has become better. only during certain animations or stages does the fps seem to drop slightly. The game at it\'s core is a pretty solid fighter. It\'s not about to redefine the genre or give Street Fighter and Guilty Gear a run for their money, but overall I could imagine people playing this game at tournaments. With that said, at the very top levels of play, certain characters do have an edge over others (Jolyne and Johnny come to mind) and some characters just aren\'t going to fare that well against others (Valentine). However, most players don\'t play at this level, and the game is designed so that even newer players stand a chance against experience players who use combos and understand the mechanics of the game well. As for mechanics specific to this game, there are stylish moves which are similar to parrying in 3rd Strike (block at the exact time someone attacks you), Stand Rush (using a stand attack, and then being able to rush down the other player with your character as your stand attacks; can be used for certain combos), puttstun cancelling (similar to roman cancel in guilty gear) and also taunt cancelling to do certain combos.\n\nOne thing about this game is that it stays incredibly loyal to the manga in terms of poses the characters make, outfits that can be unlocked, dialogue the characters have among one another. Also the abilities themselves, even the ones that seem broken at first, are in the game and made to be somewhat balanced overall. For example, you can become Ultimate Kars, Use C-Moon and Made In Heaven as Enrico, you can get Gold Experience Requiem as Giorno, you can stop time and reenact the final battle of Jotaro vs DIO in Jotaro vs DIO matches, you can upgrade Tusk up to Act 4 and use him essentially exactly as Johnny does (complete with "Chummiiii!" sounds), you can use all of Mista\'s Sex Pistols to have bullets flying all around the screen, you can make Joseph taunt by telling people what they\'re going to say next. As I\'ve said previously, this game is at its core, a work of fanservice for fans of the JoJo manga. In this sense, it\'s a great work. Some have complained about renamings in the localizations, but at the end of the day these renames are mostly in subtitles only. You will always hear Avdol call Polnareff "Polnareff" even if the subtitles say "Eiffel". You can always turn subs off, but honestly if you\'ve read the manga and know all the characters, you are always going to hear Jolyne crying out "Stone Free!" or Giorno saying "Gold Experience Requiem!" among others.\n\nOverall, I would say if you are a fan of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, you\'re just depriving yourself if you don\'t buy this game. If you\'re a fan of the fighting genre, try the game out as a demo or at a friend\'s house and see if you think it would be fun for you. I would almost give this game a perfect 10, but the lack of character balance at top tiers, the sloppy launch by Bandai-Namco USA and the occasionally laggy netcode all detract from the experience. If the netcode and character balance was improved by patching from Namco/CC2, I\'d give this game a perfect 10 as being one of the best new fighters and one of the best products ever produced in the JoJo franchise.'}

The roster is massive and it has something for everyone, from the likes of Hogan and Andre to Austin and The Rock, right up to guys like CM Punk and Daniel Bryan.The game itself is very similar to WWE'13, the people about this game clearly can't comprehend the fact that this is still a THQ game with the 2K logo plastered all over it, you cannot expect to see 2Ks input until next years title at the very least. However, the game modes such as WWE Universe and 30 Years of WrestleMania make this game very entertaining, with a lot of archive footage being used to tell the stories of each match. As for the creative side of things, I'd say this years game is the best ever, there have been numerous improvements to the CAW mode, players allowed to now use in-game wrestlers like Jericho and Punk as a template, Create-A-Finisher and Create-an-Arena are still as strong as they were in the previous titles so there's a lot to offer for those people that are into the creative side of things.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is great! I'd recommend it to anyone who is a hardcore wrestling fan or even someone who is just a casual fan, it's very entertaining and worth the £35 price tag."}

{'Title': "JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE ALL-STAR BATTLE", 'Platform': 'PlayStation 3', 'Release_Date': 'Apr 29, 2014', 'MetaCritic_Score': '71', 'User_Score': '8.1', 'Developer': 'CyberConnect2', 'Description': 'A lot of the critical reviews for this game appear to be from people who have probably never read the JoJo manga before and are simply judging it on the basis of being a complete outsider to the series. To me this seems unfair to what this game was meant to be; first and foremost, this game was designed to be fanservice for fans of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure. So far only Parts 1-3 have been animated, and the other 5 story arcs most likely won\'t be animated for a few years. However, this game brings the entire manga to life. If there\'s one thing you can truly say about this game, it\'s that it is incredibly loyal to the manga that it\'s based on. While there is a heavier focus on characters from Parts 2-5, no story arc in the manga has been left in the dust. You can play as several of your favourite characters in the series, and if you can\'t fight as them, at the very least you\'re likely to find them appear in the background of a stage, as a stage hazard, as one of the many characters guiding your around the game\'s menus, as one of the characters giving you support items and battery charge in the campaign or appearing in some other way. In Japan at least, the game\'s release was such an affair that the game itself had it\'s own training with JoJo characters all over it running for a few weeks.\n\nThe game itself has great graphics, some have complained in the past about the Japanese version being only 30fps, but the game itself looks so fluid now that I think the fps has become better. only during certain animations or stages does the fps seem to drop slightly. The game at it\'s core is a pretty solid fighter. It\'s not about to redefine the genre or give Street Fighter and Guilty Gear a run for their money, but overall I could imagine people playing this game at tournaments. With that said, at the very top levels of play, certain characters do have an edge over others (Jolyne and Johnny come to mind) and some characters just aren\'t going to fare that well against others (Valentine). However, most players don\'t play at this level, and the game is designed so that even newer players stand a chance against experience players who use combos and understand the mechanics of the game well. As for mechanics specific to this game, there are stylish moves which are similar to parrying in 3rd Strike (block at the exact time someone attacks you), Stand Rush (using a stand attack, and then being able to rush down the other player with your character as your stand attacks; can be used for certain combos), puttstun cancelling (similar to roman cancel in guilty gear) and also taunt cancelling to do certain combos.\n\nOne thing about this game is that it stays incredibly loyal to the manga in terms of poses the characters make, outfits that can be unlocked, dialogue the characters have among one another. Also the abilities themselves, even the ones that seem broken at first, are in the game and made to be somewhat balanced overall. For example, you can become Ultimate Kars, Use C-Moon and Made In Heaven as Enrico, you can get Gold Experience Requiem as Giorno, you can stop time and reenact the final battle of Jotaro vs DIO in Jotaro vs DIO matches, you can upgrade Tusk up to Act 4 and use him essentially exactly as Johnny does (complete with "Chummiiii!" sounds), you can use all of Mista\'s Sex Pistols to have bullets flying all around the screen, you can make Joseph taunt by telling people what they\'re going to say next. As I\'ve said previously, this game is at its core, a work of fanservice for fans of the JoJo manga. In this sense, it\'s a great work. Some have complained about renamings in the localizations, but at the end of the day these renames are mostly in subtitles only. You will always hear Avdol call Polnareff "Polnareff" even if the subtitles say "Eiffel". You can always turn subs off, but honestly if you\'ve read the manga and know all the characters, you are always going to hear Jolyne crying out "Stone Free!" or Giorno saying "Gold Experience Requiem!" among others.\n\nOverall, I would say if you are a fan of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, you\'re just depriving yourself if you don\'t buy this game. If you\'re a fan of the fighting genre, try the game out as a demo or at a friend\'s house and see if you think it would be fun for you. I would almost give this game a perfect 10, but the lack of character balance at top tiers, the sloppy launch by Bandai-Namco USA and the occasionally laggy netcode all detract from the experience. If the netcode and character balance was improved by patching from Namco/CC2, I\'d give this game a perfect 10 as being one of the best new fighters and one of the best products ever produced in the JoJo franchise.'}

However, the game modes such as WWE Universe and 30 Years of WrestleMania make this game very entertaining, with a lot of archive footage being used to tell the stories of each match. As for the creative side of things, I'd say this years game is the best ever, there have been numerous improvements to the CAW mode, players allowed to now use in-game wrestlers like Jericho and Punk as a template, Create-A-Finisher and Create-an-Arena are still as strong as they were in the previous titles so there's a lot to offer for those people that are into the creative side of things.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is great!

{'Title': "JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE ALL-STAR BATTLE", 'Platform': 'PlayStation 3', 'Release_Date': 'Apr 29, 2014', 'MetaCritic_Score': '71', 'User_Score': '8.1', 'Developer': 'CyberConnect2', 'Description': 'A lot of the critical reviews for this game appear to be from people who have probably never read the JoJo manga before and are simply judging it on the basis of being a complete outsider to the series. To me this seems unfair to what this game was meant to be; first and foremost, this game was designed to be fanservice for fans of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure. So far only Parts 1-3 have been animated, and the other 5 story arcs most likely won\'t be animated for a few years. However, this game brings the entire manga to life. If there\'s one thing you can truly say about this game, it\'s that it is incredibly loyal to the manga that it\'s based on. While there is a heavier focus on characters from Parts 2-5, no story arc in the manga has been left in the dust. You can play as several of your favourite characters in the series, and if you can\'t fight as them, at the very least you\'re likely to find them appear in the background of a stage, as a stage hazard, as one of the many characters guiding your around the game\'s menus, as one of the characters giving you support items and battery charge in the campaign or appearing in some other way. In Japan at least, the game\'s release was such an affair that the game itself had it\'s own training with JoJo characters all over it running for a few weeks.\n\nThe game itself has great graphics, some have complained in the past about the Japanese version being only 30fps, but the game itself looks so fluid now that I think the fps has become better. only during certain animations or stages does the fps seem to drop slightly. The game at it\'s core is a pretty solid fighter. It\'s not about to redefine the genre or give Street Fighter and Guilty Gear a run for their money, but overall I could imagine people playing this game at tournaments. With that said, at the very top levels of play, certain characters do have an edge over others (Jolyne and Johnny come to mind) and some characters just aren\'t going to fare that well against others (Valentine). However, most players don\'t play at this level, and the game is designed so that even newer players stand a chance against experience players who use combos and understand the mechanics of the game well. As for mechanics specific to this game, there are stylish moves which are similar to parrying in 3rd Strike (block at the exact time someone attacks you), Stand Rush (using a stand attack, and then being able to rush down the other player with your character as your stand attacks; can be used for certain combos), puttstun cancelling (similar to roman cancel in guilty gear) and also taunt cancelling to do certain combos.\n\nOne thing about this game is that it stays incredibly loyal to the manga in terms of poses the characters make, outfits that can be unlocked, dialogue the characters have among one another. Also the abilities themselves, even the ones that seem broken at first, are in the game and made to be somewhat balanced overall. For example, you can become Ultimate Kars, Use C-Moon and Made In Heaven as Enrico, you can get Gold Experience Requiem as Giorno, you can stop time and reenact the final battle of Jotaro vs DIO in Jotaro vs DIO matches, you can upgrade Tusk up to Act 4 and use him essentially exactly as Johnny does (complete with "Chummiiii!" sounds), you can use all of Mista\'s Sex Pistols to have bullets flying all around the screen, you can make Joseph taunt by telling people what they\'re going to say next. As I\'ve said previously, this game is at its core, a work of fanservice for fans of the JoJo manga. In this sense, it\'s a great work. Some have complained about renamings in the localizations, but at the end of the day these renames are mostly in subtitles only. You will always hear Avdol call Polnareff "Polnareff" even if the subtitles say "Eiffel". You can always turn subs off, but honestly if you\'ve read the manga and know all the characters, you are always going to hear Jolyne crying out "Stone Free!" or Giorno saying "Gold Experience Requiem!" among others.\n\nOverall, I would say if you are a fan of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, you\'re just depriving yourself if you don\'t buy this game. If you\'re a fan of the fighting genre, try the game out as a demo or at a friend\'s house and see if you think it would be fun for you. I would almost give this game a perfect 10, but the lack of character balance at top tiers, the sloppy launch by Bandai-Namco USA and the occasionally laggy netcode all detract from the experience. If the netcode and character balance was improved by patching from Namco/CC2, I\'d give this game a perfect 10 as being one of the best new fighters and one of the best products ever produced in the JoJo franchise.'}

The roster is massive and it has something for everyone, from the likes of Hogan and Andre to Austin and The Rock, right up to guys like CM Punk and Daniel Bryan.The game itself is very similar to WWE'13, the people about this game clearly can't comprehend the fact that this is still a THQ game with the 2K logo plastered all over it, you cannot expect to see 2Ks input until next years title at the very least. However, the game modes such as WWE Universe and 30 Years of WrestleMania make this game very entertaining, with a lot of archive footage being used to tell the stories of each match. As for the creative side of things, I'd say this years game is the best ever, there have been numerous improvements to the CAW mode, players allowed to now use in-game wrestlers like Jericho and Punk as a template, Create-A-Finisher and Create-an-Arena are still as strong as they were in the previous titles so there's a lot to offer for those people that are into the creative side of things.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is great! I'd recommend it to anyone who is a hardcore wrestling fan or even someone who is just a casual fan, it's very entertaining and worth the £35 price tag."}

{'Title': 'TEKKEN TAG TOURNAMENT', 'Platform': 'PlayStation 2', 'Release_Date': 'Oct 25, 2000', 'MetaCritic_Score': '85', 'User_Score': '8.5', 'Developer': 'Namco', 'Description': 'This is definatly a step up to the arcade version and quite possible my faviroute Tekken game in the series so far. Tekken Tag Tournament is the first instalment of the "Tag" series and brings back previous characters from the earlier Tekken games. The graphics have certainly boosted up a notch from the PS1 and Arcade versions, some of the stages are fantastic - pyramid temples, colosseum\'s and dojos. Gameplay is still the same as before, but there are some new fighting moves, different game modes to play and for the first time you can play as not one, but two characters in each fight. Not all characters are available to start off with, you have to unlock them in Arcade mode. Fight your way through 8 different stages by kicking, punching and wrestling each opponent and you will unlock a new character as well as a nice short theatre clip from each character you complete Arcade in. If you\'ve played Tekken before, then most of the moves you\'ll know already but if you\'re new to the series, you may want to get some practicing done in Practice mode. You can change the difficulty settings if want to challenge yourself and become a master at the game. Of course this game wouldn\'t be Tekken without (my personal faviroute) multiplayer, where you and your friend can choose two different characters (4 altogether). Another new feature to this game is if you have a Multitap, you can have up to 4 players to make it even more enjoyable. You and your friends can get loads of aggressive fun, competing against one another to become the champion. If that wasn\'t enough for you why not play a much relaxing game of bowling, yes you heard me right bowling, something you might wanna try if you have a bad headache after all that anger and shouting from multiplayer. One thing that disappoints me is even though you can use two characters tag in each fight, the round ends after one of them is defeated rather than finish them both off. This would have been a nice option to let you configure this. Usually I would get bored of the same old repetitive fighting but it still manages to charm for the fourth time running.'}

Toshinden is one of the early games of the platystation 1, released in 1995, it diverges from the traditional 2-d fighting games introducing a 3d environment where players can move on the z axis. Adding another dimension is vital to dodge special moves. This game is also interesting because every character has its own weapon, from blade to gun, in addition to classic kicks. I loved it as a kid because every fighter felt different and balanced, also the last boss (and secret boss) has a remarkable battle theme. It's a classic gem from the past and everyone should play it."}
