{'Title': "JOJO'S BIZARRE ADVENTURE ALL-STAR BATTLE", 'Platform': 'PlayStation 3', 'Release_Date': 'Apr 29, 2014', 'MetaCritic_Score': '71', 'User_Score': '8.1', 'Developer': 'CyberConnect2', 'Description': 'A lot of the critical reviews for this game appear to be from people who have probably never read the JoJo manga before and are simply judging it on the basis of being a complete outsider to the series. To me this seems unfair to what this game was meant to be; first and foremost, this game was designed to be fanservice for fans of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure. So far only Parts 1-3 have been animated, and the other 5 story arcs most likely won\'t be animated for a few years. However, this game brings the entire manga to life. If there\'s one thing you can truly say about this game, it\'s that it is incredibly loyal to the manga that it\'s based on. While there is a heavier focus on characters from Parts 2-5, no story arc in the manga has been left in the dust. You can play as several of your favourite characters in the series, and if you can\'t fight as them, at the very least you\'re likely to find them appear in the background of a stage, as a stage hazard, as one of the many characters guiding your around the game\'s menus, as one of the characters giving you support items and battery charge in the campaign or appearing in some other way. In Japan at least, the game\'s release was such an affair that the game itself had it\'s own training with JoJo characters all over it running for a few weeks.\n\nThe game itself has great graphics, some have complained in the past about the Japanese version being only 30fps, but the game itself looks so fluid now that I think the fps has become better. only during certain animations or stages does the fps seem to drop slightly. The game at it\'s core is a pretty solid fighter. It\'s not about to redefine the genre or give Street Fighter and Guilty Gear a run for their money, but overall I could imagine people playing this game at tournaments. With that said, at the very top levels of play, certain characters do have an edge over others (Jolyne and Johnny come to mind) and some characters just aren\'t going to fare that well against others (Valentine). However, most players don\'t play at this level, and the game is designed so that even newer players stand a chance against experience players who use combos and understand the mechanics of the game well. As for mechanics specific to this game, there are stylish moves which are similar to parrying in 3rd Strike (block at the exact time someone attacks you), Stand Rush (using a stand attack, and then being able to rush down the other player with your character as your stand attacks; can be used for certain combos), puttstun cancelling (similar to roman cancel in guilty gear) and also taunt cancelling to do certain combos.\n\nOne thing about this game is that it stays incredibly loyal to the manga in terms of poses the characters make, outfits that can be unlocked, dialogue the characters have among one another. Also the abilities themselves, even the ones that seem broken at first, are in the game and made to be somewhat balanced overall. For example, you can become Ultimate Kars, Use C-Moon and Made In Heaven as Enrico, you can get Gold Experience Requiem as Giorno, you can stop time and reenact the final battle of Jotaro vs DIO in Jotaro vs DIO matches, you can upgrade Tusk up to Act 4 and use him essentially exactly as Johnny does (complete with "Chummiiii!" sounds), you can use all of Mista\'s Sex Pistols to have bullets flying all around the screen, you can make Joseph taunt by telling people what they\'re going to say next. As I\'ve said previously, this game is at its core, a work of fanservice for fans of the JoJo manga. In this sense, it\'s a great work. Some have complained about renamings in the localizations, but at the end of the day these renames are mostly in subtitles only. You will always hear Avdol call Polnareff "Polnareff" even if the subtitles say "Eiffel". You can always turn subs off, but honestly if you\'ve read the manga and know all the characters, you are always going to hear Jolyne crying out "Stone Free!" or Giorno saying "Gold Experience Requiem!" among others.\n\nOverall, I would say if you are a fan of Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, you\'re just depriving yourself if you don\'t buy this game. If you\'re a fan of the fighting genre, try the game out as a demo or at a friend\'s house and see if you think it would be fun for you. I would almost give this game a perfect 10, but the lack of character balance at top tiers, the sloppy launch by Bandai-Namco USA and the occasionally laggy netcode all detract from the experience. If the netcode and character balance was improved by patching from Namco/CC2, I\'d give this game a perfect 10 as being one of the best new fighters and one of the best products ever produced in the JoJo franchise.'}
{'Title': 'BLAZBLUE: CHRONO PHANTASMA', 'Platform': 'PlayStation 3', 'Release_Date': 'Mar 25, 2014', 'MetaCritic_Score': '83', 'User_Score': '8.2', 'Developer': 'Arc System Works', 'Description': 'With the Cauldron shattered and the cycle broken, Ragna begins his final mission: Hunt down the villainous Terumi. Noel\'s life and the fate of the entire world hang in the balance as Ragna the Bloodedge marches toward one last confrontation. BlazBlue: Chrono Phantasma introduces a new fighting system called "Overdrive." With this, characters can become more powerful, possibly enough to turn the tide of battle. The fighting has also been sped up, meaning faster, more enjoyable play.'}

The roster is massive and it has something for everyone, from the likes of Hogan and Andre to Austin and The Rock, right up to guys like CM Punk and Daniel Bryan.The game itself is very similar to WWE'13, the people about this game clearly can't comprehend the fact that this is still a THQ game with the 2K logo plastered all over it, you cannot expect to see 2Ks input until next years title at the very least. However, the game modes such as WWE Universe and 30 Years of WrestleMania make this game very entertaining, with a lot of archive footage being used to tell the stories of each match. As for the creative side of things, I'd say this years game is the best ever, there have been numerous improvements to the CAW mode, players allowed to now use in-game wrestlers like Jericho and Punk as a template, Create-A-Finisher and Create-an-Arena are still as strong as they were in the previous titles so there's a lot to offer for those people that are into the creative side of things.\n\nOverall I'd say this game is great! I'd recommend it to anyone who is a hardcore wrestling fan or even someone who is just a casual fan, it's very entertaining and worth the £35 price tag."}

At first the controls are a little confusing but after you get the hang of it is a lot easier. This is an ARCADE fighter and not a sim like undisputed and I am glad because although is not perfect, overall is a great fighting game. The story mode is OK but I am all about battling with my friends and breaking some bones.

It may not be to everybody's taste but you can see that a lot of effort has been put into the art. It's colourful, pretty unique and more importantly it fits perfectly with the general cartoonish atmosphere of the game. I really liked the fact that this game does not take itself seriously.\nYou punch fratboys, you spank bankers, you punish corrupt cops and more generally you bring justice to white collar criminals.There again, it might not be for everyone's taste but personally, I really appreciated this effort. It's not so often that we have a game who is tongue-in-cheek and not afraid to be politically incorrect. It was especially true for the ending of the game which really surprised me and reminded me of a silly version of Streets of Rage.\n\nApart from that its a pretty standard beat'em up with a lot of action and some effort to make the levels as varied as possible. Good thing is, you can play in co-op with a friend on the same screen and use some pretty funny collaborative attacks. I must say however that II was disappointed the game did not have some kind of XP system to unlock new moves as well as suffering from a few glitches.\nIt's good, funny and original but it could definitively be much better : 7/10"}

After six hours deep into the storyline, I realized that Punch Time Explosion was not an attempt for the creators to make a quick buck. The game has great production value, great gameplay, and awesome wi-fi multiplayer (even though my roommates are better than me).\n\nWe used to play a LOT of SSBB, and when we started playing Punch Time, it brought back some great memories. The game has a good range of characters that are nicely balanced. I actually like that the makers of the game followed some of the rules that Smash did. Your damage percentage goes up during a fight, which will make you fly farther off the arenas. The characters have Smash attacks that can be timed to do a lot of damage. I wish Smash was on 3DS, but since it's not, you can at least play Punch Time. It's easily the best smash fighter out there on 3DS.\n\nThey definitely chose the best characters from Cartoon Network. Samurai Jack and the Powerpuff Girls are probably the best fighters, in my opinion. However, my roommates tend to use Dexter, Grim, Ben10, and Numbuh One the most. You'll have to play the game to find your best characters.\n\nThe reason why I'm giving the game a 10, is because it's a brand new title on a brand new console, and offers quality art and gameplay. I was getting bored with playing Street Fighter, because I had already played it to death on 360. Of all the original titles for 3DS, this is the best one."}

I thought back to the ps2 era MK games and few positive adjectives came to my mind. Add to that the underwhelming MK vs. DC Universe of a few years ago and my hopes were decidedly bottom of the barrel when it came to MK9. But this morning I got a call from my brother this morning at 1:30 saying he had just picked up MK9 and was coming over. Now, you have to understand that I haven\'t heard from my brother in over a year. To make a long story short, at our parent\'s funeral in Winter 2010 there was a huge fight. My brother told me and the other siblings he would never speak to us again. It hurt to hear my big brother regard us so harshly and honestly, the last year has been hell for me. So when I heard from him this morning it was quite the shock.\n\nWhen he got here we exchanged few words and proceeded to start up the game on my 50" HD TV. I was hesitant at first and refused to play versus mode to start, telling my brother to simply play story mode while I watched. It didn\'t take us long to realize how magnificent this game truly was. During one of the early cutscenes my brother let out in amazement "it\'s like they\'re rewriting my childhood, hell yes." I don\'t want to spoil anything for you, but the story mode is the most awesomely presented story in fighting game history. I\'m not ashamed to say there were a few high fives exchanged amongst us when we finally beat the last bosses. I had to get my hands on all the characters after that. We immediately went into versus and started taking eachother on just like we had in MKII for the SNES. It was one of the best experiences of my life. The gameplay isn\'t hard to get into and I can tell there\'s going to be a lot of room to get better. Maybe one day I\'ll even be able to beat big bro!\n\nSo as 7AM hit us and we decided to get some rest, I realized something. None of the old hardships came back to light. This was fun like My brother and I hadn\'t experienced in ages. Fun I thought I had lost forever. Through all the gore and friendly competition we both realized what makes us equals as men, but more importantly, what made us equal as brothers. So as the sun rises here, I\'m telling you, go out and buy this game.'}

You pair the fighter with arcana unique style for mix of the arcana ability and the the fighters ability, creating a ton of customization in how to use your fighter. The game also supports an amazing netcode which makes the game amazing experience online and because you have excellent netcode you are better off playing with people in US and japan which makes for amazing competition. Seriously more fighting games need to be like this and blazblue, cause these two games raised the bar in online play by leagues.I would love to see street fighter and tekken get this amazing online netcode. Anyway the biggest turn off is that the characters can be very, well jail bait. Crazy anime fanservice and all young female cast can be a bit getting used to. But either way if you are willing to look past that there is a very deep fighter with amazing online and offline modes (especially how smooth the online is), give it a chance and you'd be surprised how good this game is."}

{'Title': 'ACCELERATION OF SUGURI X-EDITION', 'Platform': 'PlayStation 3', 'Release_Date': 'Feb 15, 2011', 'MetaCritic_Score': '61', 'User_Score': '5.5', 'Developer': "Rockin' Android", 'Description': "An extremely competent and original girl-on-girl (sans the one male character in the 12-character roster) competitive fighter/shooter with a great deal of flair, color, strategy, depth, and variety, all of which is well worth the ludicrously cheap $5.99 asking price, which even includes a bonus theme and the entire soundtrack. This could easily have been $14.99, and justifiably so. The amount of content present goes far beyond what's expected of a $5.99 throwaway title. This is definitely not a throwaway title. Aside from the different forms of Suguri, who all play fairly similarly, every character plays very uniquely, with their own strengths and weaknesses. As for what makes it unique, while the game does have a typical Hyper gauge that goes up depending on how many hits you get in or how many projectiles you absorb, it also has something called a Heat percentage. Normally, the Heat is at zero, and can go as high as 300%. The percentage Heat that you have is exactly how much extra damage you take from attacks; so if you have a percentage of 100, you will be given twice as much damage as normal. Heat is accumulated for the most part by dashing. Here's the thing: Dashing doesn't just get you out of the way of an attack. Dashing also leaves behind a trail of rings, which absorb enemy projectile attacks. When this happens, you absorb those projectiles into your Hyper gauge. Learning how to manage dashing and your Heat is critical to succeeding. This one particular mechanic is what differentiates this game from others of its type (of which there are few). It forces you to risk greatly lowering your defense to fill your Hyper gauge. Note that dashing also allows you to become invulnerable to some attacks, as does the Shield mechanic. Basically, all I'm saying is that this is one seriously complex game, and way more than what would be expected from a $5.99 fighting game with twelve anime characters, a handful of arenas, only a couple of modes, and some very nice bonuses in the form of story sequences for each major character (Sora, an unlockable character, has a very unique story sequence, and is the only sequence to be animated, despite being very short compared to the others). It's an excellent fighter, the characters all have personality and detailed backstory, the story modes are entertaining and humorous, the dialogue shifts from funny to shockingly macabre (Hae's backstory of being kidnapped and forced to stay in a dark room which she is not allowed to leave is stunningly heartrending, and was especially impacting and incredibly contrasting considering Saki's very lighthearted story involving pudding, cooking, and making people happy), and the game has a huge amount of personality with the cool fighting mechanics and flash to back it up. The added bonus story sequences are a great touch, and the two brief but entertaining story modes are also fun to play through. The bonus soundtrack provided, plus the theme and background, are very well done, and make that $5.99 even more worth it. For anyone with the slightest interest in fighters of this sort, especially those with a fan of manga-style characters and storylines, this is an obvious purchase. Mastering it is extremely difficult, and to learn the ins and outs of its mechanics takes time and practice. Just remember to read the wiki of this to have an idea of where to start. Great, great game. Just unreal value for the money."}

{'Title': 'EA SPORTS MMA', 'Platform': 'Xbox 360', 'Release_Date': 'Oct 19, 2010', 'MetaCritic_Score': '79', 'User_Score': '8.0', 'Developer': 'EA Tiburon', 'Description': 'BEFORE I get into EA MMA I would like to lead in with a little insight as to where MY review comes from! I also have been an MMA Participant/Fan since the Beginning! I have Played everything from UFC on Dreamcast, Tapout 1 & 2 on XBOX, UFC Sudden Impact & PRIDE FC on PS2, Throwdown on Nintendo GameCube, UFC Undisputed 2009/2010 & NOW EA MMA on 360! That was Not meant to be a BragFest but rather a recap of Where My Opinions/Comparisons come from! The Original DreamCast UFC was, of course, the GroundBreaker that Started it all! UFC 2009, to me, was The BEST MMA game to Date! 2010 Seemed like a Rushed (to beat EA to release!) Cash grab and NOT Much More than a Roster Update with Few Real Notable changes. The Event Mode being the Most memorable & my personal Favorite. Now for EA MMA!: First off if they would have named it something like "EA Sports Presents MMA Featuring StrikeForce!" there Might be LESS complaints about "where are the UFC guys?"! Maybe! From the beginning I Too did Not give much chance for EA\'s MMA title. Like a Lot of Fellow gamers I fell into the "If it doesn\'t have the More Well Known UFC Fighters It will Probably Not be as Good!" category! I am GLAD to say I was Wrong there! There are So Many Exclusive fighters that are as good or Better than their UFC counterparts In there own respective weight classes! There are also Very Extensive Fighter Creation/Share tools (They are Far Superior to THQ UFC\'s current version!) that Offer NEAR Perfect UFC Clones! For those Longing for Dream matches like Brock Lesnar vs Fedor Emelianenko Here is the Place to get it! Well this is as Close as we can get for now at least! There are also other Various COOL Options to keep fights from getting stale. Venue Locations, Ring Types (Round, Boxing & Of Course Octagonal) Plus being able to set Rule types are a Nice and Refreshing change of pace! I haven\'t jumped into the Career mode so I can\'t comment on that Yet. I feel compelled to voice my concern and comment that ONLY EA can Tank (No. Not Paul Abbot!) its MMA Game at this point by Pulling the Online support like it has done with a Lot of its other Franchises! For MMA and just Fighting Game Fans alike EA Sports MMA is the BEST way to put a Digital BeatDown on/with your friends! I feel the Competition here Is a Good thing! Look at how Tekken, Soul Calibur & Street Fighter and Forza & Gran Turismo Push each other to improve! THQ and EA can continue to Pour quality features into their Games! In the end we win! Like Arcade Style Fighting, Racing Games etc... I have NO problem owning 2 MMA games. IF they are Both well made & are each worth having! My reviews tend to be scatterbrained! For that I apologize. My Main goal is to Help Fellow gamers that are fans of the Same genre be able to enjoy quality games! This Also put a BullsEye on me for tweens & Other ADHD FOOLS to Jab at MY Review Instead of My Online Fighter! Keep in mind witty review Blasters: My review does NOT Hit Back. I DO!'}

They can make it palatable to Americans, but something else will result, and it will not be a lucha libre video game anymore. You cannot Americanize Lucha Libre, because then it looses it's cultural value, the largest obstacle in this game being the language barrier, some things just don't translate form Spanish very well...so it would have been better to just adapt it to English and had English commentators do the talking just like they do for WWE. I would imagine subtitles don't help much either, nevertheless I can say native Spanish speakers do not have as much trouble understanding the game. Anyway, if they ever make a second game, it's probably going to be better than this one...but then again every single video game out there is meant for Americans."}
